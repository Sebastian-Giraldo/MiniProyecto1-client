        <h1>Hello There! I am Sebastian. Nice to meet you.</h1>
        <p>
          As a Systems Engineer graduated from Universidad del Valle, I
          specialize in FullStack, Cloud and Cybersecurity development. For the
          past 5 years, I have worked as a freelancer, collaborating with
          agencies, startups and talented professionals to create digital
          products for both business and consumer use. My low-key but confident
          approach allows me to approach projects with confidence, always
          looking to improve my skills and stay on top of the latest trends and
          technologies. My natural curiosity drives me to constantly explore new
          ideas and innovative solutions to the challenges I face in my daily
          work.
